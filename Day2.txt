Introduction to linux 
-Linux is "Kernel"
    -Kernel is a program which is used to communicate our software and hardware 
-The first Linux device was made on 1969 on PDP-7 mini computer 
-It was made because their leader(Thompson) want it familiarity with the system from his hobby work on it and it wasn't cheap and open source 
-Then Linus trovalds he created Linux operating system, released the initial version of the Linux kernel in 1991 and also amde it open source 
-His Github https://github.com/torvalds
-But right before Trovalds there was GNU project in 1983 which was announced by richard stallman
-It was free replacement for the UNIX And it was only replacement which mean it wasn't full OS 
-The combination of 'UNIX' 'GNU' gave us GNU/Linux OS 
-So the shell is where all maic will appear 
-Shell is Used to communicate with the 'Kernel'
-It simply convert the Input of the user to Language understand by The Kernel
-Generally there are around 7 common shell types based on their feature 
    - Bourne Shell (sh)
    - Bourne Again Shell (bash)
    - Z Shell (zsh)
    - Fish Shell (fish)
    - PowerShell
-They differ in Colouring,Piping,command compilation,some kind of features If u want to identify your shell type 'echo $shell'
-So what is OS 
-An operating system(OS) is software that manages computer hardware and software resources, providing a platform for other programs to run and facilitating user 
 interactions with the computer
-So Linux is a free and open-source operating system renowned for its stability, security, and versatility
-It contain 
    - Kernel
    - Softwares
    - libraries
    - utilities
-There are several popular desktop environments available for Linux, each offering a different user experience and visual style. Here are some examples:
    - GNOME
    - KDE Plasma
    - Xfce
    - Cinnamon
    - MATE
    - Unity
-Why linux??
    People choose Linux for several reasons:

   1. Open Source: Linux is open source, meaning its source code is freely available. This allows users to customize, modify, and distribute the operating system 
    according to their needs.

   2. Stability and Reliability: Linux is known for its stability and reliability, making it an excellent choice for critical systems and servers that require 
    uninterrupted operation.

   3. Security: Linux is inherently more secure than many other operating systems, thanks to its robust permission system, regular security updates, and a vast 
    community of developers constantly reviewing and improving its security.

   4.Flexibility and Customization: Linux offers a high level of flexibility and customization, allowing users to tailor their system to their specific 
   requirements, whether it's the choice of desktop environment, software packages, or system configurations.

   5.Wide Range of Software: Linux provides a vast selection of free and open source software, including powerful development tools, office suites, multimedia 
   applications, and more, offering a comprehensive software ecosystem.

   6.Community and Support: Linux has a vibrant and supportive community of users and developers who actively contribute to its development, provide assistance, 
     and share knowledge through forums, mailing lists, and online resources.

   7. Cost-effectiveness: Linux is typically free to use, which can lead to significant cost savings, particularly for businesses and organizations that don't 
      have to pay for expensive software licenses.
